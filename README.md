# Xandeum Exporter for Prometheus

This is a complete, modular monitoring solution for Xanduem validator nodes and stake pools. The main
component is a [Xandeum](https://github.com/xandeum/xandeum) metrics exporter for Prometheus
initially based on the [solana-exporter original](https://github.com/rustiqtech/solana_exporter) by rustiq
but refactored for the Xandeum L1 blockchain.
